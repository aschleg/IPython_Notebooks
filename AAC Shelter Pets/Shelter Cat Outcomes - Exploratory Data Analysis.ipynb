    "The [Austin Animal Center](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/aac) is the largest no-kill animal shelter and shelters and protects over 18,000 animals each year. As part of the [City of Austin's Open Data Initiative](https://data.austintexas.gov/), the Center makes available their data detailing shelter pet intake and outcomes. According to the data portal, over 90% of animal outcomes are adoptions, transfers to other shelter partners or returning lost pets to owners.\n",

By performing [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) we can unveil potential patterns and trends to help inform what features and terms are included in our final prediction model.\n",
